# Simple Notes Manager  

**Simple Notes Manager** is a MERN stack application that allows users to add, view, and delete notes. It provides a minimal yet functional interface to manage notes efficiently.  

## Features  

‚úÖ Add new notes (title, content, category)  
‚úÖ View all notes in a card-based layout  
‚úÖ Delete existing notes with a single click  
‚úÖ Minimalist UI with simple CSS styling  
‚úÖ Validates the required fields title, category, textcontent
‚úÖ Each note should have a delete button to remove it


## Tech Stack  

### Backend:  
- **Node.js** with **Express.js**  
- Simple in-memory storage (No database for simplicity)
- ‚ö† **Note:** This project does **not** use local storage or a database. Since the backend stores notes in an in-memory array, all data will be lost when the server restarts.


### Frontend:  
- **React.js** (Functional components with hooks)  
- **Axios** for API requests  
- **CSS** for basic styling  

## API Endpoints  

| Method | Endpoint         | Description |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| POST   | `/api/notes`    | Add a new note (title, content, category) |
| GET    | `/api/notes`    | Retrieve all notes  |
| DELETE | `/api/notes/:id`| Delete a note by ID |
